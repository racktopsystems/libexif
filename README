DESCRIPTION
-----------

libexif is a library for parsing, editing, and saving EXIF data. It is
intended to replace lots of redundant implementations in command-line
utilities and programs with GUIs.

FEATURES
--------

libexif supports parsing, editing and saving of EXIF data. In addition, it
has gettext support. All EXIF tags described in EXIF standard 2.1
are supported.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

libexif is written in plain C and does not require any additional library.

LIMITATIONS
-----------

libexif can only handle some maker notes, and even those not very well. More
work needs to be done. Note that libmnote has been merged with libexif - it
is no longer needed.

FRONTENDS
---------

Right now, I know of the following frontends to libexif:
 - exif:     A small command-line utility to show EXIF information in JPEG
             files (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libexif).
 - gexif:    A GTK+ frontend for editing EXIF data
             (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libexif).
 - gphoto2:  A command-line frontend to libgphoto2, a library to access a 
             wide range of digital cameras (http://www.gphoto.org).
 - gtkam:    A GTK+ frontend to libgphoto2 (http://www.topfrose.de).
 - thirdeye: Digital photos organizer and driver for eComStation
             (http://ecomstation.ru/thirdeye).
If you would like to migrate your program to use libexif or add EXIF support
to it, don't hesitate to contact the authors.

BUGS
----

libexif includes a 'libjpeg' that is 'educational code to illustrate the
syntax of JPEG files'. Please ignore it. It is a bug that it is 
distributed, but I think it may be useful for other people.

AUTHORS
-------

libexif has originally been written by Curtis Galloway
<curtisg@users.sourceforge.net>. Because of the original design not
supporting editing and saving, Lutz Müller <lutz@users.sourceforge.net>
rewrote libexif from scratch.
