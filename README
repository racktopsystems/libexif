DESCRIPTION
-----------

libexif is a library for parsing, editing, and saving EXIF data. It is
intended to replace lots of redundant implementations in command-line
utilities and programs with GUIs.

FEATURES
--------

libexif supports parsing, editing and saving of EXIF data. In addition, it
has gettext support. All EXIF tags described in EXIF standard 2.1
are supported.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

libexif is written in plain C and does not require any additional library.

FRONTENDS
---------

Right now, I know of the following frontends to libexif:
 - exif:    A small command-line utility to show EXIF information in JPEG files
            (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libexif).
 - gexif:   A GTK+ frontend for editing EXIF data
            (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libexif).
 - gphoto2: A command-line frontend to libgphoto2, a library to access a 
            wide range of digital cameras (http://www.gphoto.org).
 - gtkam:   A GTK+ frontend to libgphoto2 (http://www.topfrose.de).
If you would like to migrate your program to use libexif or add EXIF support
to it, don't hesitate to contact the authors.

AUTHORS
-------

libexif has originally been written by Curtis Galloway
<curtisg@users.sourceforge.net>. Because of the original design not
supporting editing and saving, Lutz Müller <lutz@users.sourceforge.net>
rewrote libexif from scratch.
