General remarks:

  * This file contains changes visible to users.

  * Small bug fixes (typos, memory leaks, ...) and feature
    enhancements (new tag types, ...) are not mentionened
    explicitly.

  * If someone wants to reconstruct past changes and log them here,
    you're welcome. Apart from that, I would like to ask committers
    to update this file when they commit user visible changes.
