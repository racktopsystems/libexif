# Notes about tests:
#  - Add "small" tests and stuff here.
#  - Add "big"   tests and stuff to explicitly test for (fixed) bugs
#    to libexif-testsuite:
#    * We don't want to force people to download dozens of test images
#      just for one small library.
#    * Proper testing is done with the "exif" program in libexif-testsuite.
#      And this is just the lib - we don't have the program available
#      here yet.
